\par The purpose of this thesis is to show how micro unmanned aerial vehicles can extract energy from natural wind gusts and how this energy extraction is affected by the effects of unsteady aerodynamics.

\par The trajectory of a small UAV flying through wind gusts is simulated with a two degrees of freedom model.
The non-dimensional model is set to include vertical and horizontal gusts of varying amplitude and duration.
From this model an optimization routine is performed in order to obtain the minimum gust amplitude needed to get a neutral energy trajectory.
With these results, it is discovered that neutral energy flight is possible through gusts speeds only 10 to 20\% of the flying speed of the aircraft .
Analysis of the results shows that the lift coefficient has to be changed very rapidly in order to perform these maneuvers in short duration gusts. 
Moreover high lift values are often required. 

\par To achieve this kind of rapid changes in the lift and drag forces, fast variations of the angle of attack are needed.
The high lift values also requires high angles of attacks that are likely to cause separation of the flow over the airfoil.
These fast variations at high angle of attack are shown to cause unsteady non linear aerodynamic responses.
A low order model based on the Goman-Khrabrov paper \cite{GK} is developed and validated against experimental results.

\par With this light model the influence of the unsteady aerodynamics on the energy extraction problem are highlighted.
