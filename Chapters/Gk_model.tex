\Section{The Goman and Khrabrov model}

\Subsection{Motivation}
In their 1994 paper entitled ``State-Space Representation of Aerodynamic Characteristics of an Aircraft at High Angle of Attack'' \cite{GK} Goman and Khrabrov introduce a new model for characterizing the lift and moment coefficients for slender delta wings.
Their goal was to study the stability of delta wing fighter jets where maneuverability is important, and to link it to physical fluid dynamic phenomenons such as vortex breakdown or flow separation.

\par The classical stability analysis method relies on a Taylor series expansion of the aerodynamic coefficients.
% maybe put an example here.
This linear representation is relatively accurate for fully attached flow but the model breaks down at higher angle of attack when separation occurs.
In the semi separated region the aerodynamic effects are mainly driven by the degree of flow separation happening on the wing.
For this reason they chose to define $C_l$ as a function of $\alpha$, the angle of attack, and a state variable $x$ representing the degree of separation.
This degree of separation can be defined as the position of the vortex breakdown point if you are looking at delta wings, or the position of the reattachment point in the case of 2D airfoils.
This allows for a model tightly defined by the physics of the flow.


\Subsection{Flow physics and state variables}
Since this study was performed with a 2D NACA0009 airfoil, we define the state variable $x$ as the position of the reattachment point.
Its value linearly change from 1 when it is situated at the leading edge to 0 when it gets to the trailing edge and beyond.
For quasi-steady cases separation point is a function of the angle of attack. If we define $x_0$ as the separation point position in a quasi-steady situation then

\begin{equation}
  C_l^{qs} = f(\alpha,x_0(\alpha))
  \label{eqn:qs_Cl}
\end{equation}

The unsteady part of the flow physics can be divided into two groups of phenomenons.

\par The firsts are the effects of the angle of attack variation speed on the position of the separation point.
Goman and Khrabrov argue that this is roughly proportional to the pitch rate $\dot{\alpha}$ and as such they can be included by modifying the quasi-steady state value by using $x_0 (\alpha - \tau_2 \dot{\alpha})$ 

\par The second phenomenon is due to the dynamics of the separated flow.
The flow has a certain relaxation characteristic under a disturbance input.
This can be modeled using a first order differential equation.

\begin{eqnarray}
  \tau_1 \frac{dx}{dt} +x = x_0(\alpha - \tau_2 \dot{\alpha}) 
  \label{eqn:state_variable}
\end{eqnarray}

\Section{Experimental Setup}

  \caption{Airfoil model inside the wind tunnel}
  \label{fig:wind_tunnel}
\end{figure}

All of the experimental part of this research was performed into the Andrew Fejer Unsteady Wind Tunnel at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago.
This is a low velocity wind tunnel with a 60cm by 60cm test section.
The wind tunnel is mainly used for unsteady aerodynamic studies.
Airfoils are mounted on a motorized sting outfitted with two linear electric servo-motors.
These servos are powered by an amplifier with a integrated PID system and driven by an analog voltage input signal proportional to the desired position.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
%		\includegraphics{<+file+>}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Pitching and plunging mechanism}
  \label{fig:pitching_mechanism}
\end{figure}

As seen on figure \ref{fig:pitching_mechanism} combining the motion of the front and back servo allows for the wing to be plunged as well as pitched around a range of axis.
The tunnel is also equipped with a system of shutters that can be used to create wind gusts.
However this feature will not be used in this project.

\par The input signal for the servos is made with Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and fed through D-Space\textsuperscript{\textregistered} as an analog voltage.

\par Several sensors are used for data acquisition.
A pair of linear potentiometers measures the position of the servos in order to get the airfoil pitch angle.
The flow speed is measure via a Pitot tube and pressure transducer plugged into a acquisition box.
In parallel to this acquisition box the forces exerted on the airfoil can be measured.
A piezoelectric ATI Nano17 force balance seats between the sting and the airfoil.
This sensor measures both absolute forces and moments along 3 different axis.

\par The wing is made out of balsa wood with a 3D printed leading edge housing the active flow control system.
This system will be described in more detail in the appropriate chapter.
The structure is wrapped in mono-coat, a heat-shrunk plastic film.
Its chord length is 245mm its width 560mm with a NACA0009 profile.
It connects to the force balance at a point at 25 percent of the chord.
The maximum was made to keep the weight and moment of inertia as small as possible to minimize the inertial effects when the wing is moving.


\FloatBarrier

\Subsection{Experimental procedure and data processing}
Different pitch input have been tried.
There was some fears at first that if the pitching axis wasn't on the axis symmetry, at the quarter chord of the airfoil, additional aerodynamic phenomenon would affect the data.
After testing different pitching input that placed the rotation axis either at the top of the front servo, at the top of the force balance or at the top of the back servo,  it was determined that the optimal way to drive the pitching mechanism was to move only the back servo.
Other input method induced to much mechanical vibrations and did not seems to make any difference aerodynamically.

\par The amplifier driving the electric servos has its own PID control system, however even after careful tunning some error exists between the commanded angle of attack and the actual angle of attack.
To negate that effect the actual servo position, as given by the potentiometers, is used for our measurements.
This data is used to transform the normal and tangent force into lift and drag (via a simple rotation matrix). 
They are then normalized to get the aerodynamics coefficients.

\par Unless specified otherwise, all the acquisitions have been done at a flow speed of 3m/s which correspond to a Reynolds number of 50000.

\par For each experimental case the force balance as well as the servo position and a synchronization signal are simultaneously acquired.
A first offset with the tunnel off and the wing pitching is taken to let us get the force balance offset as well as record the inertial effects.
Even tho the wing is only weighing around 300 grammes, these inertial effects represent the majority of the forces measured by the force balance.
Moreover some of the force measured come from the springiness of the cables used for the active flow control part.
After the first offset the real case is taken, followed by a second offset to account for the drift in the force balance measurement sometime seen over the course of several minutes.

\par During each acquisitions at least 50 cycles are recorded.
This allows us to perform what we call phase averaging.
This is done by slicing the files into individual cycles (thank to the synchronization signal) and then making an average of these cycles.
With this technique the signal to noise ratio of greatly improved.
Once this has been done with the 2 offsets and the proper acquisition itself, aerodynamic forces are obtained by subtracting the offsets.
All this processing is done with Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered}. 

\par The servo actuation system has a small but noticeable dead band as well as a delay between the input and output.
This makes the actual pitching motion slightly different from the input.
To account for that the actual measured pitch angle is used as an input of the GK model when we want to compare its prediction with the experimental data.

\par Finally the GK model itself is also implemented in Matlab.
The code can be seen in annex \ref{ch:GK_code}.

\Section{Adapting the GK model to the NACA0009}

\Subsection{Steady lift and stalling behavior}
With the basics of the GK model defined, the goal is now to adapt it to our objectives.
If this model is to be used for optimization purposes the drag also needs to be calculated.
The original model defined by Goman and Khrabrov was included the lift and pitching moment coefficients.
Similarly to their model the assumption is made that the lift and drag coefficients share the same state variable.
As such we define $f$ and $g$ as

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}[c]{c}
    C_l=f(\alpha,x) \\
    C_d=g(\alpha,x)
  \end{array}
  \label{eqn:lift_drag_functions}
\end{equation}

\par The other difference with their case study is that we are considering a 2D airfoil whereas they modeled a 3D delta wing.
This means that we can't reuse the same lift function $f$ as the original paper.

\par In order to get an accurate equation for the lift and drag a quasi-steady map of the lift and drag coefficients is made.
This map is done by very slowly (0.1 degree per seconds) pitching the wing between -5 and 25 degrees.
The free stream speed has to be corrected to account for the flow slowing down during the higher blockage ratio at high angle of attack.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \scalebox{0.8}
    {\includegraphics{./Figures/NACA0009_steady_map_Cl_Cd.eps}}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Lift and drag coefficient in the quasi-steady case}
  \label{fig:QS_Cl_Cd_vs_alpha}
\end{figure}

\par Figure \ref{fig:QS_Cl_Cd_vs_alpha} shows how the aerodynamics behave for our NACA0009 airfoil.
The lift coefficient is close to a clean linear function when the flow is attached.
The separation happens around 8 degrees and the lift coefficient remains constant in the 10 to 20 degrees zone when the flow is partially separated.
At higher angle of attack the flow is totally separated and $C_l$ is once again proportional to $\alpha$ but with a different slope this time.
Even though the NACA0009 has a symmetric profile the measured lift coefficient for a angle of attack of zero is not null.
It is suspected that the sting onto which the airfoil is fixed may disturb the flow and cause this asymmetry.
Moreover this curve differs slightly from the ones found in the literature.
Once again this can be attributed to the experimental setup; other than the sting effects the couple of millimeters of clearance between the wall of the wind tunnel and the edge of the airfoil are probably to blame as they induce some 3D effects.
These gaps are necessary for to allow for the both pitching and plunging of the wing.

\par From this static map we can approximate the part where the flow is still attached (<8 degrees) by 

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}[c]{c}
    C_l= 2 \pi \cdot \alpha + C_l0 \\
    C_d= \frac{C_l^2}{2G_{max}} + C_d0
  \end{array}
  \label{eqn:attached_Cl_and_Cd_vs_alpha}
\end{equation}

Which is remarkably close to the classical theoretical result for a 2D airfoils in a ideal inviscid attached flow.

\Subsection{State variable approximation}
When the flow is still attached the value of $x$ is 1. 
This means that we are considering the separation point to be at the trailing edge.
Similarly when the flow is totally separated the separation point is at the leading edge and $x=0$.
Since for totally separated flow the slop of the lift coefficient as a function of $\alpha$ can be approximated to about $0.4$ of the slope for the attached flow, we choose to use the following equation for the lift over the whole range of angle of attack. 

\begin{equation}
  C_l(\alpha,x)=2 \pi \cdot \alpha (0.6 x + 0.4) + C_l0
  \label{eqn:Cl_function}
\end{equation}

\par By inverting this equation the value of $x_0$ can then be adjusted so that the output of this function matches the experimental data. 
The resulting profile for $x_0(\alpha)$ can be seen in figure \ref{fig:x_0_vs_alpha}

\begin{figure}[h]

    \scalebox{0.8}
    {\includegraphics{./Figures/x_0_vs_alpha.eps}}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Quasi-steady profile for the state variable $x$}
  \label{fig:x_0_vs_alpha}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier
With this profile we get a good approximation of the experimental $C_l(\alpha)$ (cf figure \ref{fig:GK_Cl_vs_alpha}) for quasi steady cases.

  \caption{Comparison between the experimental and model quasi-steady lift}
  \label{fig:GK_Cl_vs_alpha}
\end{figure}

\par The assumption that the drag share the same state variable as the lift is confirmed when the following equation produces similarly accurate results compared to experimental data, as seen on figure \ref{fig:GK_Cd_vs_alpha}.

\begin{equation}
  C_d(\alpha,x)= \frac{ \left( \left( 2 - x \right)C_l \right)^2 }{2 G_{max}} + C_d0
  \label{eqn:Cd_function}

\par These two relatively simple equations shows that a physics based GK model can be implemented for both lift and drag and that they indeed depend on the same state variable.
The two time constants $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ will be determined in the next section when the wing undergo unsteady pithing.

\FloatBarrier
\Section{Model validation}

\par While the ability to predict lift and drag based on separation can be useful, the real strength of the GK model resides in its ability to work on unsteady cases.
The first step is to determine the 2 $\tau$ time constants. 
To do that a series of pitching cases are performed. 
The pitching inputs are the following

\begin{equation}
	\alpha\left( t \right)= A \sin \left( 2 \pi \frac{t}{f} \right) + \alpha_0
	\label{eqn:pitch_input}
\end{equation}

With $A=2^\circ$ and $\alpha_0=12^\circ$.
The frequency $f$ is set to 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 Hz (respectively K of 0.064, 0.128, 0.257 and 0.513)

\end{figure}

\par On these figures it is easy to notice the influence of the time delays on the aerodynamic coefficients.
At the lower frequencies the loops are quite open and a significant difference exists between the lift obtained during the pitch up and the pitch down phase.
These lift value circulate on these loops rotating in an anti-clockwise direction.
This means that the lift is higher during pitch down maneuver.
Contrastingly this behavior disappears at higher frequencies.
For K values of 0.257 and 0.513 the difference between the pitch up and pitch down is lower.
However the lift variation amplitude is more pronounced in those cases.

\par Before using the Gk model as a predictive tool the time constants need to be found.
This is done by trial and error.
The two time constants are determined manually and are tuned to produce the best results at the different frequencies tested.
$\tau_1$ is found to be equal to 3.06 t+ (0.25s) and $\tau_2$ is 4.29 t+ (0.35s).


\par The reason for the difference in behavior between the high and low frequencies is that at low frequencies the flow has the time to separate from the airfoil, this can be checked by the fact that state variable $x$ is driven by the time constant $\tau_1$.
The characteristic frequency corresponding to this time constant is about $k=1.02$.
For $k$ values of 0.257 and up, the low order filter described by the state variable equation \ref{eqn:state_variable} start to be more apparent.
A higher frequencies the flow doesn't have the time to separate and the lift coefficient is mainly driven by the $2\pi\alpha$ multiplier.
This can be seen on the by overlaying a line with a $2\pi\alpha$ slope on the results.

\par Theoretically the value of $\tau_1$ could be found by analyzing the output of small step input for the angle of attack.
In this situation $\dot{\alpha}$ at the time the step is taken but it doesn't last long enough affect the value of the state variable since the first order differential equation for $x$ acts as a low pass filter.
This means that for a small step $C_l$ from 12 to 13 degrees the output lift looks like the following figure.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
%  \includegraphics{}
  \caption{Cl behavior for a instantaneous step from 12 to 13 degrees as simulated by the GK model}
  \label{fig:Cl_for_alpha_step}
\end{figure}

\par From this classical methods used to find the time constant for first order system can be used.
As you can see in the figure \ref{fig:tau_1_identification}, the $\tau_1$ constant found from the GK model output is really close to the one used in the model.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
%  \includegraphics{<+file+>}
  \caption{Identification of $\tau_1$ from the step response}
  \label{fig:tau_1_identification}
\end{figure}	

\par While this method is fine in theory, it is impossible to implement experimentally.
The force balance used to measure lift and drag is very fragile so a fast step could be enough to break it.
Furthermore any slower of even smoothed step input modifies the lift response enough to make the time constant identification impossible.
While this method is unpractical for experimental cases it should be applicable in the case of CFD simulations.

\par Now that the model is complete its accuracy can be checked.
The most obvious result is that the shape of the lift and drag versus angle of attack curves are similar to the experimental results.

\par This behavior can be checked for other frequencies as well.

\end{figure}

\par Similarly another set of acquisitions is made at a mean angle of 10 degrees (see figures \ref{fig:Pitching_allcases_GK_Cl_10} and \ref{fig:Pitching_allcases_GK_Cd_10}).
\par The area around 10 degrees is interesting because this is where the flow just starts to be get separated.
The transition between attached flow and separated flow means that the state variable $x$ shouldn't have any effect for the lower angles and as a consequence the loop seen in the $C_l$ versus $\alpha$ plots should be ``pinched'' on its left side.
This can be further illustrated by plotting the value of the state variable during this kind of maneuvers, it is constrained by the saturation of this value at one.
This kind of behavior is particularly apparent on high amplitude (tens of degrees) pitch manoeuvre as it is seen in the original Goman and Khrabrov paper.
The behavior is comparable at K of 0.257 and 0.513 but the drag has a noticeably different shape at K of 0.128.



For some unknown reason the model does not seems to account for the hysteresis at this frequency.

\par Another obvious parameter to check for our model is the amplitude of the oscillations.
The amplitude is set to a range from 1 to 4 degrees at different mean angle of attack.
The predictions still reasonably match the experimental results. 

% divers figures


\par To simulate a more realistic pitch profile, a pseudo-random pitch profile is designed.
The input is constructed as seen in equation \ref{eqn:random_pitch_input} with a randomized phase difference $\varphi_i$ between each harmonic components.

\begin{equation}
	\alpha_{random}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} \sin (\frac{2 \pi t}{f_i} + \varphi_i)}{B} + \alpha_{0}
	\label{eqn:random_pitch_input}
\end{equation}

The frequency are regularly spaced between 0.25 and 2Hz and the constant $B$ is chosen to make sure the maximum deviation from the $\alpha_0$ value is no more than 2 degrees.
This is done so that the bandwidth of the input signal is limited.

\par This model is producing accurate results that account for both the dynamic effects and the flow separation.
Moreover the procedure is light enough to be implemented into the optimization algorithm without increasing too much the computation cost

\Section{Implementation in the energy extraction algorithm}

\par As seen in the previous chapter the optimization process for the energy extraction trajectory only requires a way to calculate the relationship between the lift and drag coefficient.
Since in our case these 2 variables depend only on the angle of attack and its change rate over time, it is fairly easy to implement it into the algorithm.
However the non dimensional time constant are different, the energy extraction one consider the optimal glide speed and the gravity acceleration whereas the one used for the GK model uses the flight speed and the chord length.

\Subsection{Relation between the different time scales}

As said before the time scale used in the two models are different.
To solve this issue the ratio of the two time constants are plotted (see figure \ref{fig:T_t+_ratio}) for a wide variety of flying objects.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{T}{t+}=\frac{V_{opt}}{g} \cdot \frac{U}{c}
  \label{eqn:T_t+}
\end{equation}

Or if the aircraft flies near its optimal glide speed

\begin{equation}
  \frac{T}{t+}=\frac{V_{opt}^2}{g \cdot c}
  \label{eqn:T_t+_ratio}
\end{equation}

This ratio happens to be the Froude number.

  \caption{T to t+ ratio for divers flying objects}
  \label{fig:T_t+_ratio}
\end{figure}

\par It is interesting to notice that this ratio is in the same order of magnitude for all these objects.
The value of 90 is chosen as a default for this ratio as it represent a good average of the data compiled.


\par Another issue is that the GK model is dependent on the initial value of the state variable $x$.
The initial value of $x$ is taken as the quasi-steady value.
To minimize the effect of the transition from quasi-steady to unsteady flow at the beginning of the maneuver, the cycle is simulated twice and then only the second cycle is considered.
This is possible to do since the conditions applied on the trajectory constrain the initial and final angle of attack to be the same.


\Subsection{Effects of considering unsteady aerodynamics on the optimal trajectory}

Unsteady aerodynamics allows access to new areas on the $C_l$ vs $\alpha$ map as well as on the lift to drag ratio map.
This effects on the lift and drag characteristics that will influence the optimization process if the pitching rate is fast enough to trigger them.
The effects on the lift can divided into two categories.

\par The first one is the time lag for the flow separation. 
If the airfoil is pitched up fast enough the flow doesn't have the time to separate and high values of Cl can be attained.
%Since during a typical gust negative and positive values are needed for the lift we can assume that the flow will reattach when the angle of attack is close to zero.
If the flow separates then behaviors like the one we saw in the periodic pitching around 12 degrees (see figure \ref{fig:Pitching_allcases_Cl_12}) will be seen.

\par The second effect is seen when high pitch rates are present.
In these cases the $\alpha - \tau_2 \dot{\alpha}$ term in the state variable equation \ref{eqn:state_variable} starts to get influenced by the $\dot{\alpha}$ term. 
For example for a 4 degrees amplitude sinusoidal pitching around a mean angle of attack of zero at a frequency of $k=0.5$ will produce unsteady effects as seen on the following figures \ref{fig:alpha_dalpha_vs_t} and \ref{fig:x_fast_pitching}.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics{./Figures/alpha_dalpha_sin_amp=4_k=0p5.eps}

  \includegraphics{./Figures/x_sin_amp=4_k=0p5.eps}
  \caption{State variable during fast sinusoidal pitching}
  \label{fig:x_fast_pitching}
\end{figure}

\par The state variable value starts at the quasi-steady value (as designed in the algorithm implementation) but after a couple of cycles it orbits close to an average value that would correspond to separated flows in a quasi-steady case.
This also leads to lower lift overall (see figure \ref{fig:Cl_fast_pitching}) since the value of x is smaller.

%Since the lift to drag ratio of the NACA0009 is about 10 (compared to 13 for the notional UAV) direct comparisons with the results presented in part \ref{sec:results_QS} are impossible.
