\Subsection{Trajectory optimization through wind gusts}
The main challenge for electric small size unmanned aerial vehicle is the autonomy.
Battery energy density is limited and can rapidly become a important part of the weight of vehicle.
Since most of the energy is used by the electric engine for propulsion, optimizing the control laws and trajectory could have a dramatic effect on endurance. 
With the progress in autonomous control software successful attempt have been made by Allen \cite{flight_test_soaring_NASA} and Edwards \cite{flight_test_soaring_NCU} to extract energy from natural updraft.
These experiments have shown that an UAV can take advantage of localized vertical winds naturally produced by thermal convection.

\par However, within an urban environment, such as the one mini and micro-UAV are made for, the gust's profile is vastly different. 
Wind blowing through an group of building produce turbulent conditions with both vertical and horizontal vortexes.
These turbulences can reach speed representing a significant portion of micro-UAV's glide speed. 
In flow fields such as this the gusts encountered are both faster and arguably more complex than the ones due to thermal convection.

\par The lack of low order models for the unsteady effects meant that all of the studies on trajectory optimization seemed to have focused on quasi-steady models to compute the aerodynamic forces.
More computationally expensive model traditionally used for CFD are too unpractical considering the thousands of functions evaluations needed for such algorithm.
To solve this problem a low order model capturing the unsteady behavior of the flow over the aircraft is needed.
Additionally this model needs to be able to handle flow separation and airfoil stalling since the maneuvers required for energy extraction can be relatively violent and often involve high angle of attack.


\Subsection{Pitching airfoil model}
The difficulty is that the lift and drag behavior in such condition is time dependent and non-linear.
As such finite elements methods are often the only solution to get a good simulation of the lift and drag.
Such solution are useful since they provide a lot of information about the flow flied itself, but the computation time required to get the lift and drag out of them is several order of magnitude too long.

\par Another solution explored by Brunton \cite{brunton2008unsteady} is to perform linear approximations of the lift and drag behavior at different angles of attack.
These linear models can then be patched together to include the non-linear behaviors.
The appeal of this method is that the individual linear models can be easily analyzed using classical LTI system theory.
It is however still fairly complicated and requires an extensive experimental study to identify the system at each set angle of attack.

\par The model developed by Goman and Khrabrov allows for a low order model non linear model to capture the features of the lift coefficient over a very wide range of angle of attack as well as for any arbitrary pitch profile.
One quasi-steady map of the lift and two time constants are all that is needed to get the full model.
So far it seems that the use of this model has been limited to the lift coefficient predictions however for the trajectory optimization the drag coefficient is also needed.

\Section{Previous investigations/literature review}

\par As explained in the previous part \ref{subsec:dynsoar}, the bulk part of the research on trajectory optimization for small flying vehicle has been focused on either natural convection such as the one glider pilots and some birds of prey take advantage of in plains, or wind gradients such the ones found close to the surface of the ocean.
The later are often exploited by seabird such as albatrosses.

\par Lissaman \cite{lissaman2005wind} has conducted a study for 3D trajectories in differently shaped wind gradients close to the ground.
His optimization is performed on a non-dimensional set of equation that has been reused in this study.
He also uses different kind of profiles for the wind gradient in order to represent more accurately real wind gradients.
