\Section{Basic Models} \label{sec:int}

In this chapter, we discuss the system identification problem for
discrete-time nonlinear dynamic systems. The discussion includes
an overview of the representations of various nonlinear systems
and their identification methods. Even though some of these
methods are developed for continuous-time system representations,
we only consider to work on the discrete-time representation of
the nonlinear systems. These techniques will guide us to develop
the FPET model structure. The main system equation we use here is:
% Equation Example1
\begin{equation}
 x^2+y^2 = z^2
 \label{eq:sample}   % is used to refer this equation in the text
\end{equation}
However, we will also represent a brief discuss on some more
complex cases as well.

\Section{Functional Series Methods in Linear Systems using Impulse
Response Generalization Algorithm}

One can represent a linear system by its impulse response.
Volterra developed a generalization of this representation for
nonlinear systems in which the single impulse response is replaced
with a series of integration kernels. This generalization of the
impulse response, usually called Volterra series, can be used to
approximate a wide variety of systems. For instance, Boyd and Chua
in \cite{HK}\footnote{Corresponding to references in the
Bibliography.} showed that a finite Volterra series can be used to
approximate any nonlinear operator which has fading memory. This
is explained in Section \ref{sec:int}. Now you will see a listing
example:
% An example for enumerate
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppression of hepatic glucose production
  \item Stimulation of hepatic glucose uptake
  \item Stimulation of glucose uptake by peripheral tissues,
  mainly muscle
\end{enumerate}

Fading memory concept can be defined as the effect of past inputs
on the present output fades out when time approaches infinity
\cite{Pan}. In general, we can write the input-output relationship
of any causal, discrete-time, time-invariant nonlinear systems by
a series of generalized convolutions \cite{MG}. Now you will see a
quotation example:

% A quotation example
% Every quota must be accompanied by a reference to the source
% in a footnote or in the Bibliography
\begin{quotation}
(This is a test for quotation environment!) In the Minimum
Variance Method, the peaks are sharp. We compare the graphs where
N=512 and p=64 and N=512 and p=128, it can be seen that when the
order p is increased frequency \cite{Boney96}.
\end{quotation}

\Subsection{Least Squares Based Identification} Block oriented
nonlinear systems can be represented by an interconnection of
linear dynamic and static nonlinear blocks. Well known block
oriented nonlinear models are Hammerstein, Wiener, and LNL
(Linear-Nonlinear-Linear) models as shown in the figure.
Hammerstein (NL, Nonlinear-Linear) and Wiener (LN,
Linear-Nonlinear) models are two special cases of the LNL cascade
model.You can see the results in Table \ref{table:nonlin}.

% Subsubsection is created using \Subsubsection{title} command, and text is
% typed in the same line.

\Subsubsection{Modified Periodogram} In the Modified Periodogram,
the spectrum is smoother and noise level is a little bit less
comparing to the Peridogram Method, since the data  is multiplied
with Hamming window. In the Bartlett Method, overlapping is not
used and K= 4. In this realization, we can see that frequency
resolution has been decreased (peaks are broader) .On the other
hand,noise level has been also reduced. As we expected, there is a
trade-off between frequency resolution and noise level. Decreasing
noise level is paid off by decreasing frequency resolution. In the
Blackman-Tuckey Method, both frequency resolution and noise level
seems good, see Figure \ref{fig:lnlblock}.

\Subsubsection{Other Useful Methods} There are some other methods
which are more complex for implementation. However, they will give
more efficient results. The figures below illustrate the results
obtained using method XYZ for a fuel metabolism process.

\Chapter{Representation of Linear Constraints Methods with Convex
Function conditions in Modern Optimization Theory }

\Section{Basic Concepts}

In this chapter we examine ways of representing linear
constraints. The goal is to write the constraints in a form that
makes it easy to move from one feasible point to another. The
constraints specify interrelationship among the variables so that,
for example, if we increase the first variable, retaining
feasibility might require making a complicated sequence of changes
to all the other variables. It is much easier if we express the
constraints using a coordinate system that is "natural" for the
constraints. \footnote{Natural means that the points be global
optimums} Then the interrelationship among the variables are taken
care of by the coordinate system, and moves between feasible
points.

There are two major results relating the primal and dual problems.
The first is called weak duality and is easier to prove.

\Chapter{Network Problems}

\Section{Basic Examples}

The most general network problem that we face with is called  the
minimum cost network flow problem.

\Section{Basis Representation} Many of the efficiencies in the
network simplex method come about because of the special form of
the basis in the network problem.
